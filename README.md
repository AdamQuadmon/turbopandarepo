## Versioning and Publishing packages

Package publishing has been configured using
[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Please review their
[documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets#documentation) to
familiarize yourself with the workflow.

This example comes with automated npm releases setup in a
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action). To get this working, you
will need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your repository
settings. You should also install the
[Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your GitHub
repository as well.

For more information about this automation, refer to the official
[changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/automating-changesets.md)

### npm

If you want to publish package to the public npm registry and make them publicly
available, this is already setup.

To publish packages to a private npm organization scope, **remove** the
following from each of the `package.json`'s

```diff
- "publishConfig": {
-  "access": "public"
- },
```

### GitHub Package Registry

[Working with the npm registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#publishing-a-package-using-publishconfig-in-the-packagejson-file)
